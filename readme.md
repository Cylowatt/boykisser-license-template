# Instructions
## Editing and Rendering
- Open the `.xcf` with GIMP, and replace the placeholder image under photo layer group with yours.
- Add your name instead of `name` using the text tool.
- Feel free to make any changes you want, for example switch the flags out (i.e. I have a pan flag on another card of mine).
- Render to PNG or some other format by selecting `File > Export As`
- Yaaaaay, you have your own boykisser license <3

## Physical Printing
- Open the `.odg` file with LibreOffice Draw, and replace the sample card with yours. Feel free to fill the whole document in. The image should already be scaled to be a size of a credit card, so roughly 85.60mm by 53.98mm. You can scale them up or down as you want.
- Print the resulting page. I print mine on photo paper for the extra gloss and put it in a card holder, or on sticker paper to be able to stick it to a plastic card.
